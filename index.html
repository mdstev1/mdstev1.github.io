<h1>Team Introduction</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our site! This site was the brainchild of 3 supremely novice web developers: Bryce, Izaak, and Michael.
    Oftentimes, the faceless, nameless web developer behind the screen intimidates people (not you, of course; other people...).
    To put the user of this site at ease, we have included a little introduction of sorts to familiarize you with the creators:
  </p>
  <h2>Michael Stevens</h2>
  <p> Michael hails from Colorado Springs, CO and tells everyone that he loves the outdoors. When he's not studying homework, he enjoys pretending he's
      good at basketball, longing to be a more adventurous hiker, and resorting to the go-to activity of productive people: Netflix & Chill.
      He is being shipped off to Mongolia next month to complete a capstone project. Graduate school is next on the horizon ("those who can't do, go to school" or something like that).
      His favorite Dan Ames class to date is 414, but the jury is still out for 514.
  </p>

  <h2>Izaak Cooper</h2>
  <p>Izaak is orginally from Henderson, NV and is obsessed with fitness. He loves to rock climb, beat his wife at racquetball (more on her later), and get big (a.k.a. lift weights).
      He even eats vegetables for a daytime snack to fuel these hobbies. Yes, vegetables. For a snack. His wife is also a Civil Engineering major, so you know what their dinner conversations consist of.
      Izaak will also be traveling to Mongolia next month (different project, same trip). Izaak also plans to pursue a graduate degree after graduation. His favorite Dan Ames class to date is 514 (until he reads this bio).

  <h2>Bryce Berrett</h2>
  <p>Bryce somehow made his way from faraway Orem, UT to BYU (just ask him how much he loves it when people comment about the trip). Bryce is a licensed drone pilot (yes, you need a license), and enjoys buzzing people on their way to class (he should have it revoked soon).
      He also loves channeling his inner Bruce Lee at ping pong and fancies himself as the next Abraham Lincoln, reading several books per day. No word yet on whether those are picture books or not.
      He intends to find a job and makes lots of money immediately after graduation... Just kidding he's going to grad school like the rest of us. His favorite Dan Ames class so far has been 414.
